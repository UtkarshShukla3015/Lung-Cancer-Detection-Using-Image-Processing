# Lung-Cancer-Detection-Using-Image-Processing
This project detects lung cancer from CT scan images using image processing and a fine-tuned DeiT model. Trained on 1400 labeled images, it classifies scans as cancerous or non-cancerous with high accuracy. Future plans include real-time deployment and 3D scan support.
